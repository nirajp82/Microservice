### What is repository?
- The repository and unit of work patterns are intended to create an abstraction layer between the data access layer and the business logic layer of an application. Implementing these patterns can help insulate your application from changes in the data store and can facilitate automated unit testing or test-driven development (TDD).

### Why Generally NoSQL database is preferred for microservice architecture.
NoSQL databases are often preferred for microservices architectures due to their alignment with the characteristics and requirements typically associated with microservices. Here's why:

1. **Simplified Data Models**: NoSQL databases offer flexible data models such as key-value pairs, document-oriented storage, and column-family storage. These models are well-suited for microservices because they allow developers to store and retrieve data in formats that directly correspond to the needs of each service. Since microservices typically handle specific functionalities, they often don't require complex relationships across the data, making NoSQL databases a good fit.

2. **Looser Consistency Models**: Microservices architectures often prioritize scalability and availability over strong consistency guarantees provided by traditional relational databases (ACID guarantees). NoSQL databases often offer eventual consistency models, which allow for high availability and scalability without the performance overhead of strict ACID compliance. This fits well with the distributed nature of microservices, where services may operate independently and require only eventual consistency.

3. **Simplified Querying**: Microservices tend to encapsulate specific business functionalities, leading to simpler and more focused data access patterns. NoSQL databases typically provide simpler querying mechanisms compared to SQL databases, which aligns well with the needs of microservices. While NoSQL databases may not offer the same level of complex querying capabilities as SQL databases, they often provide efficient access patterns tailored to the specific data models they support.

4. **Low Latency, High Availability, and Scalability**: Microservices architectures often require low-latency access to data, high availability, and the ability to scale horizontally. NoSQL databases are designed with these requirements in mind, offering features such as distributed data storage, automatic sharding, and replication for fault tolerance. These features make NoSQL databases well-suited for microservices architectures deployed in distributed and cloud environments.

In summary, NoSQL databases are preferred for microservices architectures because they offer flexible data models, looser consistency guarantees, simplified querying mechanisms, and features optimized for low latency, high availability, and scalability. However, it's essential to evaluate the specific requirements and trade-offs of each application scenario to determine the most suitable database technology. In some cases, a combination of NoSQL and SQL databases may be appropriate to address different aspects of microservices' data storage and access patterns.
